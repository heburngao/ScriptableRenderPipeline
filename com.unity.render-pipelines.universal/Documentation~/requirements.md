## Render pipeline compatibility

Projects made using URP are not compatible with the High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP) or the Built-in Render Pipeline. Before you start development, you must decide which render pipeline to use in your Project. For information on choosing a render pipeline, see the [Render Pipelines](https://docs.unity3d.com/2019.3/Documentation/Manual/render-pipelines.html) section of the Unity Manual.

## Unity Player system requirements

This package does not add any extra platform-specific requirements. General system requirements for the Unity Player apply. For more information on Unity system requirements, see [System requirements for Unity](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/system-requirements.html).
